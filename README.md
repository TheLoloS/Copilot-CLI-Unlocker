# Copilot CLI Unlocker - Enhanced Fork

[![CI Tests](https://github.com/TheLoloS/Copilot-CLI-Unlocker/actions/workflows/ci-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/TheLoloS/Copilot-CLI-Unlocker/actions/workflows/ci-tests.yml)

A tool to add custom models to GitHub Copilot CLI's allowed models list.

> **Note:** This is a fork of the original [copilot-cli-free-models](https://github.com/agileandy/copilot-cli-free-models). Special thanks to the original creator [@agileandy](https://github.com/agileandy) for his work. This version has been enhanced to provide native support for both Bash (Linux/macOS/WSL) and Windows PowerShell, and it patches both required model arrays for full compatibility with /model command.

This fork introduces two dedicated scripts:
- `patch-models.sh`: For Bash-based systems (Linux, macOS, WSL).
- `patch-models.ps1`: For native Windows environments using PowerShell.

## What's New in This Fork?

- **Dual Script Support**: Native scripts for both PowerShell on Windows and Bash on other systems.
- **Dual Array Patching**: The script now patches both the simple model name array and the model object array (which includes labels), ensuring models appear correctly in any UI that uses them.
- **Expanded Default Models**: Now includes `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-5-mini`, `grok-code-fast-1`, `gemini-2.5-pro` by default.

> [!WARNING]
> **A Note on Copilot CLI Versions `0.0.357`**
>
> Version `0.0.356` of the Copilot CLI briefly introduced experimental models (`gpt-5-codex`, `gpt-5.1`, `gpt-5.1-codex-mini`, `gpt-5.1-codex`). However, in the very next version (`0.0.357`), GitHub **removed the API connection code** for these models, making them non-functional. Now in version `0.0.358`, they have restored the code for these models.
>
> Our goal is to patch in only *working* models. Therefore, this script will not add these specific models on `v0.0.357`.
>
> **If you wish to use these experimental models, you must use Copilot CLI version `0.0.356` or `0.0.358+`. otherwise they will not work!** you can switch to that version by:
>```bash
>npm install -g @github/copilot@0.0.356
> or
>npm install -g @github/copilot@0.0.358+
>```

- **In-App Model Switching**: After patching, you can switch between the added models using commands like `/model` directly within the Copilot CLI interface.

## Platform Compatibility

**Note:** This script performs text-based find-and-replace on minified JavaScript. Different Copilot CLI versions may have different internal structure. Always test with `--dry-run` first.

## Requirements

### Suported Versions
- GitHub Copilot CLI version `0.0.354`.
- GitHub Copilot CLI version `0.0.355`.
- GitHub Copilot CLI version `0.0.356`. (They added new models: gpt-5.1,gpt-5.1-codex-mini,gpt-5.1-codex)
- GitHub Copilot CLI version `0.0.357`. (They remove code for added models: gpt-5.1,gpt-5.1-codex-mini,gpt-5.1-codex? wierd...)
- GitHub Copilot CLI version `0.0.358`. (They fix and restore code for added models: gpt-5.1,gpt-5.1-codex-mini,gpt-5.1-codex 🩷)
- GitHub Copilot CLI version `0.0.359`.

### After Patching (Both Systems)

Thanks to the dual-array patch, you can now switch between the newly added models directly from the Copilot CLI using the `/model` command.

Editing your configuration file is **optional**. You only need to edit `~/.copilot/config.json` if you want to set a **default model** that the CLI will use at startup.

**To set a default model (Optional):**
Edit the file at `~/.copilot/config.json` and set the `model` property:

```json
{
  "model": "gpt-5-mini"
}
```

If you don't set a default, you can still access the new models anytime by typing `/model` in the Copilot CLI prompt.

## Version Compatibility & Branching
Since the Copilot CLI's internal structure can change with updates, this repository will use branches to track unlocker versions that are compatible with specific releases of `@github/copilot`.

If the script on the `main` branch fails after a CLI update, please check the repository's branches for a version named after your CLI version (e.g., `copilot-v1.20.0`).


## Usage

### Bash (`patch-models.sh`)

**Default Usage (Recommended)**
This will patch the CLI with the default set of models: `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `grok-code-fast-1`.
```bash
./patch-models.sh
```

**Add Specific Models**
Use the `--models` flag to add a custom list of models instead of the default ones.
```bash
./patch-models.sh --models o1
```

**Patch a Custom Location**
```bash
./patch-models.sh --file /path/to/custom/index.js
```

### PowerShell (`patch-models.ps1`)

**Default Usage (Recommended)**
This will patch the CLI with the default set of models: `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-5-mini`, and `grok-code-fast-1`.
```powershell
.\patch-models.ps1
```

**Add Specific Models**
Use the `-Models` parameter to add a custom list of models instead of the default ones.
```powershell
.\patch-models.ps1 -Models "o1"
```

**Patch a Custom Location**
```powershell
.\patch-models.ps1 -File "C:\path\to\custom\index.js"
```

## How It Works

The Copilot CLI's `index.js` is a large minified file containing hardcoded arrays of allowed models. This fork's patcher locates and modifies **two** of these arrays:

1.  **A simple name array:**
    ```javascript
    // Variable name changes between versions (e.g., Yv, Ef)
    Yv=["claude-sonnet-4.5","claude-sonnet-4",...]
    ```
2.  **An object array with labels:**
    ```javascript
    // Variable name also changes (e.g., Dwe)
    Dwe=[{model:"claude-sonnet-4.5",label:"Claude Sonnet 4.5"},...]
    ```

The unlocker auto-detects the variable names and safely appends your desired models to both lists, ensuring full functionality. A timestamped backup is always created before any changes are made.

## Adapting for Future Updates

If a future Copilot CLI update breaks the unlocker, you'll need to find the new patterns for both arrays or wait for update of Copilot-CLI-Unlocker.

1.  **Locate the arrays** by searching the `index.js` file for known model names like `"claude-sonnet"` or `"gpt-5"`.
2.  **Find the variable names** they are assigned to (the characters before the `=`).
3.  **Update the search patterns** in the script. Both `.sh` and `.ps1` scripts have clearly marked regex patterns that can be adjusted. Always test your changes with `--dry-run` or `-DryRun`.

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "Could not find models array"
The file structure has likely changed in a new Copilot CLI update. Check the branches of this repository for a version compatible with your CLI version. If one doesn't exist, you may need to follow the "Adapting for Future Updates" section.

### Error: "Replacement failed"
This can happen if the file is write-protected or if the script's patterns no longer match. The script should automatically restore from backup.

### Model Still Not Working
1.  Verify the patch was applied by searching for one of your added models inside the `index.js` file.
2.  Double-check your `~/.copilot/config.json` for correct spelling and syntax. The model name is case-sensitive and must be an exact match.
3.  Check any updates of Copilot CLI or Copilot-CLI-Unlocker
4.  Check your configuration at https://github.com/settings/copilot/features
5.  Create Issue in this repo

## Automated Testing & Reliability

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration (CI) to ensure that both patcher scripts (`.sh` and `.ps1`) work correctly across multiple operating systems. Every change pushed to the repository is automatically tested on:

-   **Linux (Ubuntu)**
-   **macOS**
-   **Windows**

This automated process verifies that the scripts can correctly locate the Copilot CLI installation and prepare the patch without errors, giving users confidence in the tool's reliability with every update. You can view the latest test results [here](https://github.com/TheLoloS/Copilot-CLI-Unlocker/actions).
